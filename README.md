## Summary

This project was created to be **100% automated**, which means, Terraform will create **all** AWS resources (VPC, Subnets, Route tables, IGW, NAT and EC2) and then **Ansible** will install, set **Kubernetes** up on the master and the EC2 nodes and deploy the **Nginx Ingress**, **WordPress** and **Bananas** apps as soon as Terraform finishes the deployment without the need to update any file, but before this make sure you've done all [prereqs](#prereq).

### Observation

Terraform will create the MySQL RDS as well as export the endpoint to **Ansible** to be used on **WordPress** Deployment. Also, the RDS password for the user, _wpmysql_, will be created via **Terraform** as well as the password via SSM Parameter, secure string, and then as soon as **Ansible** starts the deployment, it'll grep this password and store it in a variable to be used on WordPress Deployment as well.

Therefore, sensitive data won't be exposed.

:warning: Make sure to check out the below information.

> 1. Make sure the file in _/group_vars/all/default.yml_ is updated according to your infrastructure.

> 2. Update the file _ansible.cfg_, parameter _private_key_file_ to your EC2 key pair in the _Dev_ directory. This Key Pair will be used to access the EC2 by Ansible.

```bash
[defaults]
inventory=./inventory/hosts
host_key_checking=false
private_key_file= path_to_your_key_pair (eg. /myfolder/mykey.pem)
```

> 3. Update **key_pair_name** variable on _main.tf_ file in the Dev directory to your EC2 key pair.

## Terraform

**Terraform project**

![terraform](./img/terraform.png)

### terraform init

Update the _main.tf_ file in the _Dev_ directory if you want to change any AWS resource name.

Access the Dev folder and run `terraform init` to initialize the project.

### terraform plan

Access the Dev folder and run `terraform plan` to check out any issue.

### terraform apply

Once itâ€™s OK, run `terraform apply`

## Horizontal Pod Autoscaler

![hpa](./img/hpa.png)

Running the below command in a couple of terminal windows, we can stress the environment and then test the HA.

```bash
while true; do curl http://my-website.ugulino.com -v; echo; done
```

As soon as the CPU will be consumed more than 50%, the pods will scale up.

As soon as the CPU will be consumed less than 50%, the pods will scale down.

# Destroy

You can destroy your environment running the below command.

```bash
terraform destroy
```
